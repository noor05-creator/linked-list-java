# Singly Linked List Implementation in Java

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a **Singly Linked List** in Java, built entirely from scratch. It is part of my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice during my BS Artificial Intelligence degree.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Insert at head, tail, and any position
- Delete from head, tail, or a specific position
- Delete node by data value
- Traverse and print the list
- Reverse the entire list
- Detect and remove a cycle using Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm

## 📂 File Structure

- `Node` class: Represents each node of the linked list
- `LL` class: Contains all core operations and logic
- `Main` class: Driver code to test the linked list operations

## 💡 Purpose

This project helps in understanding the internal working of a linked list by manually creating all the core functionalities, without using Java’s built-in LinkedList class.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- IDE: IntelliJ / VS Code / Eclipse (any Java-supported IDE)

## 🧠 Key Learning Areas

- Pointer manipulation in Java
- Cycle detection using two-pointer technique
- Edge case handling for insertions and deletions
- Memory reference understanding
